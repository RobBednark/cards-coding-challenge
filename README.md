Coding Challenge Directions:

- Using Python, write a set of classes that represent a deck of cards. 
- You should be able to "shuffle" the deck. 
- You should also be able to draw cards from the deck one at a time until the deck is empty. 
- Unit tests are required, and the code should be usable from other code. 

[I have tested this solution with Python 2.7.10 and 3.5.1]
